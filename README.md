### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Pavel

I am interested in ML technologies and their application in various fields. I have noticed that many industries, such as banking and manufacturing, actively utilize new technologies related to machine learning, which not only increases productivity but also opens up new possibilities. These include predicting unpredictable physical processes, forecasting demand and supply in consumer markets, modeling chemical processes in the human body, and creating more effective medications based on such modeling.

I enjoy reading about the latest advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, which is replacing certain manual tasks performed by humans. I am eager to take on new projects and enhance the efficiency of both production processes and everyday life using machine learning and artificial intelligence in collaboration with others.
